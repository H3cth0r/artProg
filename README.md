# Computational Tools:the art of programming

This is the repository for the "art of programming" subject. For this 
project we'll be using the module called "freegames", wich contains a 
set of videogames made on the library called "Turtle".
For this project we must complete the games, creating new functions for
the videogames or making some changes. The general idea for this, is
for us to practice how to document python code and to use the Git tool
for collaborating.

## Games 
As said, we worked in some freegames module small-games. For this
subject, we worked on five games, the following ones, with was was done:
- **cannon.py** : the objetiveof this game is to shoot some kind of 
bullet
to some target, whish are blue circles. For firing the 
bullet, the user must direct his mouse to the blue circles
and fire to them. In the case of this game, we were required that the
movement velocity of the proyectile and the blue circles, to be faster;
we were also required to make the game to be everlasting. <br> 
- **memory.py** : this game is just a copy of the popular game of memory.
On this version, the things to remember in each card is a number ran
ging from 1 to 32; each time the user asserts a pair of numbers, the
tails are removed and the user'll be able to se how a image is formed
each time the user asserts. In the case of this game, we were required
to display the score or number of assertions of the user; we were also
required to detect when the user has finished the game and display an
ending message; we had to fix how the numbers were display over the 
tails, to align the number to the center; we had to create a new 
version of the game, but with a different way of represeting the numbers
or values behind each tail, this how mamory2.0.py was created. <br>
- **memory2.0.py** : This the alternate version of the last explained
videogame. In this case, the values under the cards will be colors,
which the user must find its paire to complete the image and game. <br>
- **pacman.py** : as it is very known, this is a replica of the famous
and popular game called pacman. In the case of this game, we were 
required to make the ghost smarter, because the videogame ghosts
were moving on a randmom way, with any specyfic direction, so we had
make the ghost to follow pacman in some kind of way; we also had to
make changes to the board and to make the ghosts faster. <br> 
- **paint.py** : In the case of this game, what we had to do was to 
create new drawing functionalities and coloring options: to add a new
color; create a functionality for drawing a circle; add a method for
drawing a rectanle and a functionality for drawing a triangle. <br>
- **snake.py** : this is also a copy of the popular and famous retro
game named "snake". On this case we had to add the functionality for
making the food move as well on the map; we had also to make the 
head of the snake and the food to change each time the game is opened
again.
